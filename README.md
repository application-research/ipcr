# Interplanetary Container Registry

tlwr;
```
$ docker tag example/helloworld ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
$ docker push ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
...
$ docker pull ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
```

The toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver container images over IPFS / Filecoin via Estuary.

This repository's main product is the Open Source Registry implementation
for storing and distributing container images using the
[OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and scalable base
for building a large scale registry solution or running a simple private registry.
It is a core library for many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry,
GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor
Project, and VMware Harbor Registry.

### Build and Run IPCR registry

1. Build the binary

```bash
$ make
```

2. Setup Config file (config.yml)

```yaml
version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry

storage:
  redirect:
    disable: false
  
  estuary:
    url: https://api.estuary.tech
    shuttle-url: https://shuttle-4.estuary.tech
    auth-token: TOKEN_GOES_HERE
    rootdirectory: /Users/satoshi/registries/estuary-prod

http:
  addr: :5005
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
health:
  storagedriver:
    enabled: true
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3

```

3. Run the service

```
$ bin/registry serve config.yml
WARN[0000] No HTTP secret provided - generated random secret. This may cause problems with uploads if multiple registries are behind a load-balancer. To provide a shared secret, fill in http.secret in the configuration file or set the REGISTRY_HTTP_SECRET environment variable.  go.version=go1.17.3 instance.id=fa0b0fca-3f04-41ac-8f95-02be502e8672 service=registry version=v2.7.0-1983-gefbad67e.m

INFO[0000] listening on [::]:5005                        go.version=go1.17.3 instance.id=fa0b0fca-3f04-41ac-8f95-02be502e8672 service=registry version=v2.7.0-1983-gefbad67e.m
...
```

#### Configure 

- Create `Dockerfile`:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM busybox:latest
    CMD echo 'hello world'
    ```

- Build Docker image:

    ```bash
    $ docker build -t example/helloworld .
    ```

    Test run:

    ```bash
    $ docker run example/helloworld:latest
    hello world
    ```

    Tag and push
    ```
    $ docker tag example/helloworld ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
    $ docker push ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
    The push refers to repository [127.0.0.1:5005/helloworld]
    eb6b01329ebe: Pushed 
    v1: digest: sha256:8c061639004b9506a38e11fad10ce1a6270207e80c4a50858fa22cd2c115b955 size: 526
    ```
    
- Pull image from IPCR registry
    ```bash
    $ docker pull ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
    v1: Pulling from helloworld
    Digest: sha256:8c061639004b9506a38e11fad10ce1a6270207e80c4a50858fa22cd2c115b955
    Status: Image is up to date for 127.0.0.1:5005/helloworld:v1
    ```

- Run image pulled from IPCR:

    ```bash
    $ docker run ipcr.io/helloworld:v1
    hello world
    ```

### Transferring images from dockerhub to registry

Included is a helper script to move all tagged images from dockerhub, quay.io, etc. to the IPCR
decentralized registry.

Below is an example call to pull and transfer all tagged alpine images

```
$ script/migrateimages alpine 127.0.0.1:5005
```

### How does this integrate with Docker, containerd, and other OCI client?

Clients implement against the OCI specification and communicate with the
registry using HTTP. This project contains a client implementation which
is currently in use by Docker, however, it is deprecated for the
[implementation in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/remotes/docker)
and will not support new features.

### What are the long term goals of the Distribution project?

The _Distribution_ project has the further long term goal of providing a
secure tool chain for distributing content. The specifications, APIs and tools
should be as useful with Docker as they are without.

Our goal is to design a professional grade and extensible content distribution
system that allow users to:

* Enjoy an efficient, secured and reliable way to store, manage, package and
  exchange content
* Hack/roll their own on top of healthy open-source components
* Implement their own home made solution through good specs, and solid
  extensions mechanism.
